# WhatTheDickens
A Lorem Ipsum Generator with a Dickensian (Oliver) Twist

## Details

The tool uses a (Monte-Carlo Markov Chain) MCMC to generate pseudo text, similar to the 'Lorem Ipsum' standard text often used in place of real content in mock-ups.

Based on the frequency of 3grams used the novels written by Charles Dickens, the function takes the last 2 words, and attempts to predict the next word. It appends a random word from the possibilities. The process is then repeated.

The output is a mixture of Paragraphs and sentences.

## Data
The book texts are provided by Project Gutenburg
